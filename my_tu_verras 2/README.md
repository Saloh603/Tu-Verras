## Task
We had a hard time extracting the print_scatter_matrix function, but we found it on Google and figured it out.
There is nothing to do with the project.

## Description
House price is a recurring subject nowadays. In this project, you will build a model to predict the price base on predefined criteria.

We are providing a dataset, the Boston housing prices.

This project is divided into two parts:
1# Understand the data
2# Build a linear regression prediction model.
